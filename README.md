 # UnDanger
 A women's safety device
 
 ## Components
 - Mobile app - React Native
 - Web server - ExpressJS
 - Microcontroller code - Raspberry Pi (Python code)
 
 Each component has its own documentation. Everything has been moved to a single repo because none of these components make sense without the others.
 
 ### Don't forget to install requirements for each module separately as per the docs.
